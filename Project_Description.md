KrishiSetu is a mobile application designed to bridge the gap between farmers and buyers by enabling direct, transparent, and fair agricultural trading.
In many rural areas, farmers are forced to rely on middlemen who take a major portion of their earnings, leaving farmers with low profit margins and limited market access. KrishiSetu solves this problem by providing a simple digital marketplace where farmers can list their produce, set their own prices, and directly connect with buyers such as retailers, wholesalers, and consumers.
The app supports farmers in uploading produce details with images, quantity, and pricing, while buyers can browse available listings, apply filters, view product details, and make offers. A built-in negotiation system allows both sides to transparently agree on a price without involvement of intermediaries. Once a deal is finalized, both parties can manage the order through a simple transaction tracking system.
Built using Flutter for fast cross-platform development and Firebase for real-time database, storage, and authentication, KrishiSetu ensures seamless performance, low latency, and easy scalability. This solution empowers farmers to earn fair value for their produce, widens buyer access to fresher goods at better prices, and ultimately promotes a more transparent and efficient agricultural ecosystem.
